        <p class="about">
            Ed Sheeran released “Shape of You” together with “Castle On The Hill.” The two songs were the 
            first releases from his third album, ÷ (Divide), following in the mathematical footsteps of 
            his + (Plus) and x (Multiply) albums. “Shape Of You” is based around a tropical house-inspired 
            lead melody and dancehall beat. A rhythm is given by xylophones, guitars, and percussions. 
            The style and rhythm have been noted as close to the Sia successes, “Cheap Thrills”, which 
            has caused some controversy. Ed has denied receiving inspiration from the track. <br>Just like 
            “Cheap Thrillqs”, however, “Shape of You” was written with the intention of it being recorded 
            by Rihanna, but Sheeran later decided to keep it for himself.In the song, Sheeran sings about 
            meeting someone at a bar and falling in love with her; a love distinct from those in much of 
            his previous work as it’s more focused on the physical than the emotional. Sheeran had teased 
            the song through a tweet that he had posted on January 5, 2017. The video had a colon that 
            would then merge into a human body, referencing the “body”-inspiration of the song. <br>As of 
            August 29, 2017, “Shape Of You” set a Billboard record, spending 33 straight weeks in the 
            Top 10 of the Hot 100 chart.<br>On September 22, 2017, the track became the most streamed song 
            of all time on the Spotify plaform at 1.318 billion plays. Sheeran passed Drake who previously 
            held the record with “One Dance.”<br>The song won a Grammy Best Pop Solo Performance at the 
            2018 Grammys held on January 28, 2018.<br>On January 24th, 2019, “Shape Of You” was certified 
            Diamond by the RIAA, selling over ten million units.</p>

        <p class="paragraph_1">
            A club isn't the best place to find a lover
            So the bar is where I go (Mm)
            Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
            Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
            And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
            And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
            Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
            And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph_2">
            Girl, you know I want your love
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me
            Well, come on now, follow my lead
            I may be crazy, don't mind me
            Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me
            Well, come on now, follow my lead
            Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

            I'm in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is fallin' too
            I'm in love with your body
            And last night, you were in my room
            And now my bed sheets smell like you
            Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
            Well, I'm in love with your body

            One week in, we let the story begin
            We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
            You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
            Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
            We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
            And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
            And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
            Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like
